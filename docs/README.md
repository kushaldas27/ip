The Elon chatbot is a tool designed to help users manage tasks efficiently. 
It allows users to create, track, and organize tasks in various categories: todos, deadlines, and events. 
Key features include adding tasks, marking them as complete, finding tasks based on keywords, 
and snoozing tasks for later.

## Adding Tasks
You can add three types of tasks:

- Todo: A general task without a deadline.
- Deadline: A task with a specific date by which it needs to be completed.
- Event: A task that occurs within a specific time range.

Example: `todo Buy groceries`
